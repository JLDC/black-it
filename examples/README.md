# Examples folder

In this folder you can find several scripts and notebooks that illustrate how to use Black-it.
Many of these examples are calibrations of the test models located in the `models` folder.

The easiest way to experiment with the examples is to clone the git repository 

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/bancaditalia/black-it.git
```

enter into the `examples` folder

```commandline
cd black-it/examples
```

run the chosen example script

```commandline
python main.py
```

or open a Jupyter notebook session

```commandline
jupyter notebook boltzmann_wealth_model.ipynb
```

Note that some examples will require you to install other packages in order to run properly, 
simply follow the instructions provided in the corresponding file.
